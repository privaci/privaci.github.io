The 3rd Annual Symposium on Applications of Contextual Integrity will take place on <br/><b>September 21-22, 2020</b> in Chicago at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu).

The aim of the symposium is to foster interaction among diverse communities of research and practice using Contextual Integrity to reason about privacy, and to design, evaluate, craft regulation, and generate formal logics for privacy.

As the goal of the workshop is to foster discussion around works in progress, the workshop will not publish formal proceedings so as to not preclude the publication of subsequent versions of those works improved by workshop feedback. However, with authors' permission, we will post accepted submissions on the website.


Submissions will be peer-reviewed by the workshop's Program Committee and accepted based on the relevance and development of the chosen topic, as well as their potential to contribute to the workshop discussions and goals.

Submissions may include:

* Empirical studies (qualitative, quantitative, experimental)
* Legal, philosophical, ethical, and policy analysis
* System design and/or implementation
* Combinations of the above

__Participation without submission:Â __ If you are interested in attending the symposium without submission, please fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/u61i8QTbGxGvYR2Y9). We will send a confirmation upon review. 

 

 With authors' permission, accepted submissions will be posted on the website, but will not be considered archival publications.
 
 We look forward to seeing you at the symposium!
