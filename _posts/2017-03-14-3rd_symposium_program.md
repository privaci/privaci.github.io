<!--## Call for Participation  
<br/>
We would like to invite you to participate 
-->

The 3rd annual Symposium on Applications of Contextual Integrity with take place on <br/><b>September 21-22, 2020</b> in Chicago at [University Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu).

<!-- Sponsor: <br/> 
* [Digital Life Initiative, Cornell Tech](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu) -->

The aim of the symposium is to foster interaction among diverse communities of research and practice using contextual integrity to reason about privacy, and to design and evaluate, craft regulation, and generate formal logics for privacy. 

As the goal of the workshop is to foster discussion around works in progress, the workshop will not publish formal proceedings (so as to not preclude the publication of subsequent versions of those works, improved by workshop feedback). However, with authors’ permission, we will post accepted submissions on the website. 

<!--The CI Symposium 2019 is supported with gifts from [Collibra](https://www.collibra.com) and [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/).
