LinkedIn makes the primary email address associated with an account visible to all direct connections, as well as to people who have your email address in their contacts lists.

In addition, the current data archive export feature of LinkedIn allows users to download their connectionsâ€™ email addresses in bulk. It seems that the archive export includes all emails associated with an account, not just the one designated as primary.
