## Directions

### By Car

Find [driving directions](http://www.princeton.edu/main/visiting/travel/driving/), [campus maps](http://www.princeton.edu/main/visiting/aroundcampus/maps), and [campus parking information](http://www.princeton.edu/main/visiting/aroundcampus/parking/) on the Princeton University website.

If you park on campus, you probably will want to park in [Lot 21](http://www.princeton.edu/parking/parkingzone.pdf) and take a Princeton [shuttle](http://www.princeton.edu/transportation/ttroutes/) to the Friend Center. Shuttles may be tracked online or through a mobile app with [TigerTracker](http://www.princeton.edu/transportation/tigertracker).

There are also metered parking spots and parking garages on campus and nearby in downtown Princeton. The closest parking is along Prospect Ave., you may also reference this [parking map](http://www.princetonparking.org/parking_map.html).

### By Plane

The closest major airports are Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). Trenton-Mercer Airport (TTN) is also nearby but serves a limited number of routes, all flown by Frontier Airlines.

Once you land, please follow the driving or train directions to reach Princeton.

### By Train

The Princeton Junction is the closest major train stop and is on both the NJ Transit [Northeast Corridor Line](http://www.njtransit.com/rg/rg_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=LineDetailsTo&selLine=NEC) and the Amtrak [Keystone Service](http://www.amtrak.com/keystone-service-train) and [Northeast Regional](http://www.amtrak.com/northeast-regional-train). These lines all serve New York Penn Station and Newark Airport (if you are flying out of EWR, be sure to get a ticket to Newark Airport, not Newark Penn Station). They also connect to the [SEPTA](http://www.septa.org/) at Trenton Station, and you can take the [SEPTA](http://www.septa.org/) to Philadelphia or other parts of southeastern Pennsylvania.

To reach the Princeton campus from Princeton Junction, you may take a 15-minute cab ride, take a Princeton [TigerPAWW bus](http://www.princeton.edu/transportation/ttroutes/), or transfer to a small train (the “Dinky”). From TigerPAWW or the Dinky, you may either walk or take a Princeton shuttle to the Friend Center.

It takes about two hours to travel from Princeton to Philadephia, New York Penn Station, or Newark Airport. If you are traveling to Newark Airport, be sure to get a ticket to the airport stop, not to Newark Penn Station.

## Recommended Lodging

Local hotels sometimes offer discounted rates for Princeton guests and visitors. If you do not have a car, you also may wish to confirm whether the hotel will have shuttle service to campus when you are staying. Additional information and hotels can be found on the Princeton [travel site](http://travel.princeton.edu/guests).
