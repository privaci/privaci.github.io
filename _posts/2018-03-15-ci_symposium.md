## Call for Participation


Symposium on Applications of Contextual Integrity  <b>September 13-14</b>, 2018  at the Center for Information and Technology Policy at Princeton University.

The aim of the symposium is to foster communication among diverse communities of research and practice that have used the theory of contextual integrity as a framework to reason about, design and evaluate, craft regulation for, and generate formal logics for privacy.  After the success of a [half-day meeting in Fall 2017](http://privaci.info/event/ci_workshop/), we are excited to follow up with a more comprehensive  event to foster discussion across a broader spectrum of disciplines. The Symposium will feature a combination of invited and submitted works.
