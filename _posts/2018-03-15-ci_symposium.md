<!-- ## New: The CI Symposium (draft) Program is out!  

Check it out [here](http://privaci.info/ci_symposium/program.html) --> 


## Call for Participation 

Symposium on Applications of Contextual Integrity  <b>September 13-14</b>, 2018  at the Center for Information and Technology Policy at Princeton University.  

You can find directions information and accomodation options [here]({{ site.url }}/ci_symposium/accomodation.html).

Co-sponsored by [Center for Information Technology Policy, Princeton University](https://citp.princeton.edu) & [Digital Life Initiative, Cornell Tech](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu).

The aim of the symposium is to foster communication among diverse communities of research and practice that have used the theory of contextual integrity as a framework to reason about, design and evaluate, craft regulation for, and generate formal logics for privacy.  After the success of a [half-day meeting in Fall 2017](http://privaci.info/event/ci_workshop/), we are excited to follow up with a more comprehensive  event to foster discussion across a broader spectrum of disciplines. The Symposium will feature a combination of invited and submitted works.
