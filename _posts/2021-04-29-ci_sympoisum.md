 We intend to hold the 3rd Annual Symposium on Applications of Contextual
 Integrity on <b>September 30- October 1</b> in Chicago at the [University of
 Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu) subject to COVID-19 restrictions. This will
 be a hybrid event in which attendees can participate either in-person or over
 Zoom. We will provide the details closer to the dates of the
 symposium.

The aim of the symposium is to foster interaction among diverse communities of research and practice using Contextual Integrity to reason about privacy, and to design and evaluate, craft regulation, and generate formal logics for privacy.

As the goal of the workshop is to foster discussion around works in progress, the workshop will not publish formal proceedings (so as to not preclude the publication of subsequent versions of those works, improved by workshop feedback). However, with authors' permission, we will post accepted submissions on the website.


Submissions will be peer-reviewed by the workshop's Program Committee and accepted based on the relevance and development of the chosen topic, as well as their potential to contribute to the workshop discussions and goals.

Submissions may include:

* Empirical studies (qualitative, quantitative, experimental)
* Legal, philosophical, ethical, and policy analysis
* System design and/or implementations
* Combinations of the above

__Participation without submission:Â __ If you're interested in attending the
symposium without submission, please fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/ZLDPZib3L71vt38ZA). We will send a confirmation upon review.

 With authors' permission, accepted submissions will be posted on the website, but will not be considered archival publications.

 We look forward to seeing you at the symposium!
