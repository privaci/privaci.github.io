We intend to hold the 4th Annual Symposium on Applications of Contextual
Integrity on <b>September 22-23 </b> in New York City, [Digital Life
Initiative](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu),
[CornellTech](http://tech.cornell.edu), subject to COVID-19
restrictions.
<!-- This will be a hybrid event in which attendees can participate either in-person or over
 Zoom. We will provide the details closer to the dates of the symposium. -->

The aim of the symposium is to foster interaction among diverse
communities of research and practice using Contextual Integrity to
reason about privacy, and to design and evaluate, craft regulation, and
generate formal logics for privacy.

**Participation without submission:** If you're interested in attending
the symposium without submission, please fill in [this
form](https://forms.gle/tMwR1tsYzvFAyKoA9). We will send a confirmation
upon review.

We look forward to seeing you at the symposium!
