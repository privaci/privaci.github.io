 We intend to hold the 5th Annual Symposium on Applications of Contextual
 Integrity on <b>September 21-22 </b> in Toronto, Canada, [Lassonde School of Engineering, York University](https://lassonde.yorku.ca). 
<!-- This will be a hybrid event in which attendees can participate either in-person or over
 Zoom. We will provide the details closer to the dates of the symposium. -->

The aim of the symposium is to foster interaction among diverse communities of research and practice using Contextual Integrity to reason about privacy, and to design and evaluate, craft regulation, and generate formal logics for privacy.


<!--
We will accept any of the following submission types:

* A 4-page position paper on work in progress (references not included in the page limit)
* An extended abstract (1-2 pages) summarizing published or mature work. Please
  include a short "works cited" section situating your work within it and clarifying its contribution. If your topic is entirely novel or interdisciplinary, please indicate that as well. If your abstract is accepted, you will have the option of posting the longer paper on the symposium website.
* A 1-page description of an interesting use case to be discussed at the symposium.
* **NEW:** Industry track: A 1-page description of real-world case study from industry or policy. (Email the organizers for more info)-->

The workshop will not publish formal (i.e. archival) proceedings. Instead, the workshop aims to foster discussion and feedback to improve work-in-progress for
subsequent publication elsewhere.  With author’s permission, accepted submissions will be posted on the website, but will not be considered archival publications.

<!--
Submissions will be peer-reviewed in a single-blind manner by the workshop’s Program Committee and accepted based on relevance and potential to contribute to workshop discussions and goals. We encourage submissions from diverse disciplinary sources, methods, and contributions, including:

* Empirical studies (qualitative, quantitative, experimental)
* Legal, philosophical, ethical, and policy analysis
* System design and/or implementations
* Combinations of the above

Papers should be formatted using the [ACM Master Article Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow). For LaTeX users, choose <b>format=sigconf</b>. -->


<!--__Participation without submission: __ If you're interested in attending the
symposium without submission, please fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/tMwR1tsYzvFAyKoA9). We will send a confirmation upon review.-->


<!-- We look forward to seeing you at the symposium!
