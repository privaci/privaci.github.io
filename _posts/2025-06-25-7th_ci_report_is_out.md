>  In May 2025, the Contextual Integrity (CI) community gathered for the 7th annual PrivaCI Symposium—the first to take place in Europe—hosted by Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Brussels Privacy Hub in Belgium. The symposium brought together over 70 researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to advance the application, critique, and extension of CI across diverse domains. Across eight sessions and community feedback discussions, participants explored how CI can inform theory, practice, governance, and standards in a rapidly evolving digital landscape shaped by artificial intelligence, generative technologies, and platform infrastructures.
