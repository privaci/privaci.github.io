The 8th Annual PrivaCI Symposium will take place on  <b>June 24-25, 2026</b> in [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA.](https://illinois.edu).

The aim of the symposium is to foster interaction among diverse communities of research and practice using Contextual Integrity to reason about privacy,   and to design and evaluate,   craft regulation,   and generate formal logics for privacy.

We will accept any of the following submission types:

* A 4-page position paper on work in progress (references not included in the page limit)
* An extended abstract (1-2 pages) summarizing published or mature work. Please
  include a short "works cited" section situating your work within it and clarifying its contribution. If your topic is entirely novel or interdisciplinary,   please indicate that as well. If your abstract is accepted,   you will have the option of posting the longer paper on the symposium website.
* A 1-page description of an interesting use case to be discussed at the symposium.
* A 1-page description of real-world case study from industry or policy.

The workshop will not publish formal (i.e. archival) proceedings. Instead,   the workshop aims to foster discussion and feedback to improve work-in-progress for
subsequent publication elsewhere.  With author’s permission,   accepted submissions will be posted on the website,   but will not be considered archival publications.

Submissions will be peer-reviewed in a single-blind manner by the workshop’s Program Committee and accepted based on relevance and potential to contribute to workshop discussions and goals. We encourage submissions from diverse disciplinary sources, methods,  and contributions,   including:

* Empirical studies (qualitative,   quantitative,   experimental
* Legal,   philosophical,   ethical,   and policy analysis
* System design and/or implementations
* Combinations of the above

Papers should be formatted using the [ACM Master Article Template]. For Latex use this [template on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc). For Word, download this [template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/article-templates/pubform.docx)



 We look forward to seeing you at the PrivaCI symposium!

Students will be provided with the support of **$1000-$1500** depending on where they are travelling from to be used towards registration, hotel and airfare costs.
