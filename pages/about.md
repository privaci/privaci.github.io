    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
      PrivaCI Institute for Technology Policy and Social Integrity is a non-profit committed to advancing the theory and practice of privacy as contextual integrity. Contextual integrity has influenced the way we think about privacy and has suggested different approaches to designing technology and forging policy. We aim to transform how privacy is understood, protected, and implemented by fostering interdisciplinary scholarship, community engagement, technological innovation, and policy impact.
